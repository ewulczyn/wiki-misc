### About the Survey
The purpose of this application is to visualize the results from a survey of English Wikipedia readers. The survey consisted of three multiple choice questions. Each question and the possible answer choices are given below. The terms in brackets represent abbreviations that are used in the data visualizations.

I am reading this article to ... [Information Need]
* look up a specific fact or to get a quick answer. [fact]
* get an overview of the topic. [overview]
* get an in-depth understanding of the topic. [in-depth]


Prior to visiting this article ... [Prior Knowledge]
* I was already familiar with the topic. [familiar]
* I was not familiar with the topic and I am learning about it for the first time. [unfamiliar]

I am reading this article because ... [Motivation]
* I have a work or school-related assignment. [work/school]
* I need to make a personal decision based on this topic (e.g., to buy a  book or game, to choose a travel destination). [personal-decision]
* I want to know more about a current event (e.g. Black Friday, a soccer game, a recent earthquake, somebody's death). [current event]
* the topic was referenced in a piece of media (e.g. TV, radio, article, film, book). [media]
* the topic came up in a conversation. [conversation]
* I am bored, curious or randomly exploring Wikipedia for fun. [bored/curious/random]

These questions and their answer choices were chosen based on an analysis of a small pilot survey in which readers were simply asked: "Why are you reading this article today?" and given a free-form text field to respond.  We discovered three response dimensions, which we broadly characterized as "Information Need", "Prior Knowledge" and "Motivation". For each dimensions, we distilled the higher level classes though a process of group coding. Each question in the survey corresponds to one of the dimensions and the answer choices represent the high-level response classes we identified.

### About the Tool

The tool shows the results of the survey and lets you explore how the answer distribution to one question changes when you condition on a specific answer for another question. Specifically, there are two rows of plots such that you can compare distributions. On the top plot you might condition on the reader being unfamiliar with the topic and in the bottom plot you might condition on the reader being familiar with the topic. Then you could compare how the distribution over the information need differs for the two groups.
